# Personal Portfolio

My personal web development portfolio to be hosted at amanda-nelson.com

## Workflow:

1. Used `npx create-react-app .` to set up blank React app and deleted some of the default content and website name and meta tags.
2. Created a mood board (in assets folder) and [wireframe](https://whimsical.com/portfolio-Srh76YpHunCeGpuhNF47jY@2Ux7TurymN91vtafjqjY) to break down what the site will look like and what components are needed.
3. Created a `Components` folder with the following components per the wireframe: `Header, About, ProjectsSection, ProjectCard, Skills, Contact, Footer`.
